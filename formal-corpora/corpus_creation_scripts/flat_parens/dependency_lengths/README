Counts of dependency lengths.

Dependency lengths of language codes are measured from a UD corpus of that language

Dependency lengths of nesting parentheses regimens (Dyck languages) are taken from simulating that process.

"short-uniform" is uniformly distributed between 1-5
"long-uniform" is uniformly distributed between 30-50

"large" is the Spanish dependency lengths, where the counts of deplenghths 1-20 are reversed, so it much favors large dependency lengths
"random" is the Spanish dependency lengths, where the counts of deplengths 1-20 are randomly shuffled between them, using the key specified in the filename.
