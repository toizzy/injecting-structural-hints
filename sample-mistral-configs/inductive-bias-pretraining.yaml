# mistral-small.yaml
#   Full Mistral GPT-2 Small Training Config, currently working with the OpenWebText Dataset, GPT-2 Small Architecture,
#   and full batch size (512). Runs with DeepSpeed ZeRO-2, with a per-device BSZ of 16.
#
#   Inheritance and core paths can all be overridden from the command line or by re-writing these files.
